# MIUI_debloater-prada
Makes any MIUI ROM lighter (prada)

Todo:

-Add hosts file to both modded and unmodded ROM to block Xiaomi servers
-Add OpenGAPPS for China ROMs

It's highly advised to NOT remove the apps before booting for the first time, ATM I don't know about the new iOS-like locked anti-theft method, so make sure to remove the apps AFTER a successfull boot and setup;
Note: Github breaks the "formating" so the scripts won't work if you just create a zip file for the script.
